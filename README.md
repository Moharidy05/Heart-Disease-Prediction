A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting heart disease risk from clinical data, featuring data preprocessing, feature engineering, multiple classification models, and performance evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and data cleaning
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new meaningful features and performs one-hot encoding
- **Feature Selection**: Uses ANOVA F-test to select most relevant features
- **Multiple Models**: Implements Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN
- **Custom KNN**: Includes a from-scratch KNN implementation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses GridSearchCV for optimal model performance
- **Visualization**: Generates correlation matrices and performance charts

## Installation
